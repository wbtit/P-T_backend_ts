MANAGER ESTIMATION ACCURACY SCORE (MEAS)
Score range: 0 → 100

Where:

100 = Perfect estimation accuracy

Above 80 = Good

Below 60 = Poor

Below 40 = Needs immediate oversight

This can expose:

Managers who consistently under-allocate (to show fake efficiency)

Managers who over-allocate (padding work)

Managers who estimate well (high-performing)

Projects at risk due to poor planning

Employees who are overloaded or underutilized
